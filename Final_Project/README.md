#EECS 368 Final Project

An interactive Haskell implementations of the A* algorithm using Haskell and Javascript.

##Backlog

#####Javascript
- Draw and save nodes for each mouseclick
    - Need Array to Push point pairs to
    - How to implement this?
- Draw and enter costs for edges between nodes
- Implement "I'm finished button using" Promises.

#####Haskell
- Continue taking notes on A* algorithm
- Look at Haskell implementations
- Break down data types

#####Completed
- Set up index.html
- Implemented onclick listeners
- Identify and display x,y coordinates of mouseclick on canvas
