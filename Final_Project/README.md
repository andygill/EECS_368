#EECS 368 Final Project

An interactive Haskell implementations of the A* algorithm using Haskell and Javascript.

##Backlog

#####Javascript
let users enter as many x,y coordinates as they want.
let users specify edges between points (draw a line, label it's cost)

######Haskell
Continue taking notes on A* algorithm
Look at Haskell implementations
Break down data types

#####Completed
- Set up index.html
- Implemented onclick listeners
- Identify and display x,y coordinates of mouseclick on canvas
